There's all kinds of music, everywhere you go
Some folks like it fast, and some like it slow
Some like it hot, some like it blue
Uh some like it old, and some like it new
Now I'm not liking country, and I'm not rappin' rap
You can make a man swing, just say my thing
No, I'm talkin' to dig, my step
The only thing that turns me on
Is when I hear a soulful song
I like soul with a capital S
Soul with a capital S
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul with a capital S
